# vuex-state-management

Uses the Vue javascript framework with Vuex state management to create a simple webpage, add weblinks to a list and remove them using mutation. 

Vuex designates a central location where the state data is stored, modified and accessed. Vuex is more suitable for larger Vue apps but the objective here was to learn how it works and then add to the app complexity later. 

This project was generated with [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) version 2.5.17, [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex) version 3.0.1 and [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) version 3.1.1


## Notes

A Gary Simon tutorial was followed to create this app.

The [Vue DevTools extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd)was useful for debugging seeing what was happening with the state when Vuex was used.
